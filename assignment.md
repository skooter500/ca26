# Computational Arts Assignment 2026

Create an "Interactive Experience" using Godot entitled: "A Day in the Life of a First Year Game Design Student". I.e. YOU

Go through your day and reflect on your daily activities (within reason!!) 

This could be:

- Picking out your clothes
- Your daily yoga practice (like me)
- Getting the bus on time
- Making tea
- Feeding your pet
- Interacting with family members
- Hanging out on the campus
- Choosing which flavours of monster are the nicest

Basically anying of note in your day and turn it into an interactive naritive. Your naritive must have:

- Start screen & Credits
- User interface elements
- 2D elements such as sprites and animated sprites
- 3D elements such as a first/third person scene
- Systems and mechanics. For example:
    - Character movement
    - NPC's
    - Dialog
    - Story
    - Missions
    - Interactive elements


Your experience can be as boring or as interesting or as personal or generic as you like. 

- Spend the next few weeks considering your day and elements that can you could create into an interactive experience
- Design a 2D experience and a 3D experience
- Develop the systems and mechanics in a Godot project
- Develop all assets your self
- No AI in any work you submit please. Make everything!
- Draw everything, Model everything, Code everything
- Publish on Itch.io & github
- Use the examples that we are developing as starter code

You must include:

- A user interface for making sounds
- Self created assets such as images and sounds
- Code in GDScript that you write yourself

In class demo at the end of the semester

Indicitive Marking Scheme:

- Computational Elements
- Aesthetic Elements
- Documentation
